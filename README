This is a simple project I've created ages ago when I was doing some research at the university.
It has no indent standard and no good habits of coding at all. But it works fine.

It is a simulator of a celular automata based on the Margolus Neighbourhood.

To compile, you'll need libgtkmm-2.4.

Compile
$ make

Clean
$ make clean
